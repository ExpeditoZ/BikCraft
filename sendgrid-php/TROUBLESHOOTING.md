# Project from Origamid — Study Version

This is a study copy adapted from the Origamid course. It was cleaned, lightly commented in English (junior level), and updated with contact placeholders for portfolio use.

## What is here
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS with Flexbox and Grid for layout
- Small JavaScript interactions (slides/animations/forms)

## Notes for learning
- Read the comments at the top of each file to understand the purpose
- Keep accessibility in mind (alt text, headings order)
- Try changing colors/spacing and observe the result
